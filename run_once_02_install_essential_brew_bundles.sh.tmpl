# FIXME: Installing perl first as a workaround to postinstall issues on Ubuntu
# Pre-install perl from source to avoid bundle issues
# Perl does not install well, yet is required by many bundles
# See: https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core/issues/4808
# This is because glibc removed xlocale.h in 2.26 (https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Release/2.26#Removal_of_.27xlocale.h.27)
# See also: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464244

# See https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/2322
# Fixed in https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/pull/2326
# It has not been added to the latest macos runner release (20201212.1) as of 12-30-20
# Remove any existing 2to3 link
